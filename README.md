- **Activity Recognition**: Human activity classification and workspace occupancy tracking
- **Pattern Analysis**: Historical trend analysis and workflow optimization insights

### üìä Reporting
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Text-based summaries for clean integration
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Detailed safety and efficiency analysis
- **Customizable Metrics**: Configurable thresholds and scoring parameters
- **Recommendations Engine**: Automated suggestions for system optimization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required packages (install via pip):

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Optional Dependencies
- `scikit-learn`: Required for anomaly detection (automatic fallback if unavailable)
- `matplotlib`: Used for non-interactive plotting backend

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** the `cobot_analytics.py` file
2. **Run the script** directly:
```bash
python cobot_analytics.py
```

3. **View the output** in your terminal - the system will generate:
   - Real-time sensor data simulation
   - Safety monitoring summaries
   - Interaction analytics
   - Comprehensive safety and efficiency reports

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from cobot_analytics import CobotDashboard

# Initialize dashboard
dashboard = CobotDashboard()

# Generate sample data
dashboard.generate_sample_data()

# Create safety summary
dashboard.create_safety_dashboard()

# Generate comprehensive report
report = dashboard.generate_safety_report()
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
# Customize safety thresholds
dashboard.sensor_data.proximity_threshold = 0.3  # meters
dashboard.sensor_data.force_threshold = 8.0      # Newtons
dashboard.sensor_data.safety_zone_radius = 1.2   # meters
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install required packages
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Scikit-learn Not Available**
   - System automatically disables anomaly detection
   - Core functionality remains available

3. **Interactive Plot Issues**
   - System uses non-interactive matplotlib backend
   - All output is text-based for compatibility

### System Requirements
- **Memory**: ~50MB for standard operation
- **CPU**: Minimal processing requirements
- **Storage**: <1MB for script and dependencies

## Integration

### Industrial Systems
- Text output designed for log aggregation
- JSON-compatible data structures
- Configurable reporting intervals
- API-ready architecture

### Monitoring Integration
```python
# Example integration with monitoring system
dashboard = CobotDashboard()
dashboard.generate_sample_data()
report = dashboard.generate_safety_report()

# Extract key metrics
safety_score = report['safety_scores']['overall_safety']
efficiency = report['efficiency_metrics']['overall_efficiency']
anomalies = report['anomaly_count']
```
